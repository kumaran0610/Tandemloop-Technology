UX UI Design Task 
I followed the Lean UX process, focusing on quick iterations and rapid experimentation design to refine this solution.
I used Figma and Photoshop for this redesign assessment

Image 1 - The design lacks a clear visual hierarchy and entry point, causing the user's eye to bounce between text and charts without a defined reading flow.
solution - I followed a center-aligned layout that improves visual hierarchy, guiding users’ attention through structured data visualization for quicker comprehension.

Image 2 - The original pricing section lacked sufficient contrast and visual hierarchy, making key actions and plans hard to notice.
solution - Enhanced contrast, increased CTA size, and applied Jakob’s Law to guide user attention through clear visual priority. By applying Jakob’s Law and Fitts’s Law, I ensured that bigger and more prominent CTAs like “Explore More” and “Create Account” naturally attract attention and become easier to access, aligning with users’ expectations.

Image 2 - The layout lacks visual hierarchy and alignment consistency, making the content feel disconnected and harder to scan.
solution - Placec the feature cards horizontally with center-aligned headings to establish visual hierarchy and guide the user’s eyes from top to bottom.
